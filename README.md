## ðŸ¤” - What is "simple-calculator"?

Well, one day I was without internet and i decided to look for something to do, so i thought about making a calculator in 1 hour, and i did it, the simple-calculator.

It is a simple calculator that shows the result in real time, supporting basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and power), in addition to values from 0 to 9 and Pi (3.1415...)
